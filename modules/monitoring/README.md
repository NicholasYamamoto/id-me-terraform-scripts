# monitoring

This module is used to deploy the Monitoring stack I decided to use to observe the Nginx ingress controller
as well as the overall System-level health of components within the cluster.

* A Deployment object Pod that contains two containers:
* A Service object that deploys a NGINX ingress controller (MAYBE)
